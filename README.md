<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
This is the second version of my portfolio. The first version was made with little to no inspiration; I sort of just designed what felt right. However, this time around I'm building my portfolio with inspiration. I am not copying their code at all...Just simply using it for design inspiration. The goal is to create a portfolio that will get me hired.
